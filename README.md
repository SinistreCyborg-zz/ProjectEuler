# Project Euler

Project Euler is an awesome site with really cool challenges pertaining to code and math. This repo is a collection of my own code that I used to solve some of those challenges.

While I don't copy entire solutions from others, I do read articles to brush up on the math involved in the question, **as is suggested by the site itself**.

You can check out these challenges for yourself here:
